### Keeping up to date
We need to keep up to date libraries and frameworks. 
You could update the dependency versions at the Sample Gradle file.


### Improve Dashboard
I'm open to any proposition on how to better display Charts and to compare Samples. 
You are welcome to open [Issues](https://github.com/paslavsky/java-microservices/issues).

[Dashboard](https://paslavsky.github.io/java-microservices/) created at React-Redux stack. 
If you are familiar with this, please welcome to update code and create PR.  

### Improve Measure Script
I wrote measure logic at [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/) with using 
[Gradle buildSrc](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#sec:build_sources) magic.
Please fill free to open PR if you see how to make the measuring process better.

### Create new Sample
Most of all, we need help with creating new Samples. By creating new Sample, 
you increase the objectivity of measurements. Please read [this document](./create-samples.md) 
for more information.
